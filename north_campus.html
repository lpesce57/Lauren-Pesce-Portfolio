    <h1>The Magic Up North</h1>

    <p>North Campus is a hidden gem of the University of Michigan. The majority of the classroom buildings, dorms, restaurants and people reside in Central Campus, making North Campus seem like a separate university. The people who do go up there consists of a small number of students: the engineers, art students and those who were forced to live in one of the two dorms. I was one of many who have been forced to live in Baits Hubbard Housing, one of the two dorms on North Campus.</p>

    <p>I was highly opposed at first, it felt like everything bad happened to me. I am always the one “randomly” selected at the airport and am constantly sick or injured; I once broke my wrist opening toothpaste. I knew my luck was never strong but I had gone in with such a positive attitude, disappointment didn&apos;t seem like a possibility. However, I never considered living on North Campus as an option, so the positive attitude did not extend to my Baits placement. I had heard little to nothing about North Campus and assumed it was reserved for only those who wanted to live there because of close proximity to classes.</p>

    <p>My best friend and I were two of four people who chose to attend the University of Michigan from our high school graduating class. We got matching senior superlatives: she won best luck, I won worst luck. That seemed to continue as I was forced into what is seen as the worst dorm on both North Campus and Central Campus, while she lived in Stockwell, a luxurious dorm usually reserved for sophomores. In an attempt to make me feel better, she sent me an article she found on why Baits was a great place to live. However, she evidently did not read the article before sending it to me, as it was a sarcastic article created to highlight the most treacherous aspects of Baits. The article discussed how it was impossible to make friends, it was the furthest dorm from campus and closest to the worst dining hall. I was devastated and felt as if my entire freshman year would be ruined because how would I make friends in a place like this? I could barely muster the courage to raise my hand in class, so I couldn&apos;t imagine anything worse than living in a place destined to make meeting people impossible.</p>

    <p>I was terribly mistaken. Living in Baits was one of the best things that could have happened to me. Yes, the complaints were true but those can be easily overlooked when compared to all the redeeming qualities. Most importantly, the friends I met in Baits were somehow better than the friend group I had envisioned for myself all of high school. I didn&apos;t know I could find people that remarkable anywhere, let alone in Baits. It was especially shocking that Baits made us closer when I had been expecting to be forced into solitude. Each room is a suite, giving us not only more space in our rooms but suitemates who despite being randomized, became some of my best friends. The daily bus rides and limited number of people who lived there pushed my friend group even closer than we would have been elsewhere. Our dorm was small enough that I could go to the lounge and it would be filled with familiar faces but big enough we had a movie theater, kitchen, lounges and a green screen room. Living on North Campus provided for so many fond memories and allowed my friend group to bond over the shared experience, long bus rides and constantly available common rooms.</p>

    <p>A lot of people at the University of Michigan have never been to North Campus, I expected myself to be one of them. However, living in Baits forced me to explore the rest of what North Campus offers, and I am so glad it did. I found myself going down to The Grove (the square containing all of the classroom buildings) to go on the swings or going to Pierpont to use the free massage chairs or spending all night studying in the Duderstadt center. I no longer live on North Campus, but that has not stopped me from visiting. It feels like an escape from reality and is both a peaceful place to study and a safe space to detach from the debilitating realties of the world. It is much less crowded than Central Campus and I normally see very few people walking, especially at night.</p>

    <p>While there might be a lack of people watching on North Campus, there are many other interesting things to look at on North Campus. Out of all the fun things to observe, one I particularly enjoy is a white sculpture that consists of many different shapes. The shapes don&apos;t seem to fit together but it flows nicely and is fun to observe regardless. I pass by this sculpture frequently, but never paid close enough attention to process how random each aspect of it was. After looking at it for a while during my North Campus observation, I decided this was the perfect sculpture to represent North Campus as a whole. Many different pieces that all fit together somehow. One part looks like an instrument whereas another looks like a roller coaster. Many completely different things that were blended together to create one beautiful piece of art.</p>

    <p>I have been to the grove countless times, however, I only realized how perfectly it all blended together when I went in with the intention of observation. Despite the darkness, my favorite time to be on North Campus is at night, it is so peaceful and the only noise is the wind, barely ever a person in sight. It is also when the string lights begin to shine, assuring everyone can view each piece of the work of art that is North Campus. I have always loved lights, they can change the ambience of any environment. They add to the peacefulness of North Campus. However, it has its own sense of harmony regardless, there is so much nature up there. So many trees and multiple forests that seem to lead to a magical unknown.</p>

    <p>Nature has always been a calming place for me, it is the one place I can feel truly alone. I find myself able to get easily absorbed in the natural beauty and distract myself from everything wrong with the world. Whether I&apos;m physically alone or surrounded by others, I am able to drown out the rest of the world and focus on the world inside me instead. Something about nature brings me alive. The fresh air and raw, authentic noises are something that cannot be recreated. The outdoors seem to have a magic spell on me, no matter what is wrong, as long as I can drag myself outside, I feel immense relief. North Campus provides me with a similar sense of comfort and peace. The nature and easiness to be alone make it even more of a safe environment.</p>

    <p>There are usually very few people walking in the Grove at night, another aspect that enhances the serenity and solitude of it. Each building has its lights on, forcing people&apos;s attention to the inside of each building, revealing the very contrasting layouts. North Campus is home to the engineering department as well as the art, music and dance departments. All of the buildings are dedicated to such different majors, so each one is unique. There is a giant rubix cube in one building and a model plane in the next. One building looked ominous and dark while another was bright and seemed to be built solely out of glass. All of the buildings might be distinctly different, but they fit together so well. I felt as if I was observing a life-sized version of the statue. Each building was so different, but as a whole it worked so well. Besides the buildings, there were countless smaller details randomly placed throughout, so subtle one could miss it with a blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>When venturing further into The Grove, I passed by a fountain I had stumbled upon many times. However, this time I noticed a group of empty picnic tables hidden away behind it. The perfect study space. I envisioned myself in the spring, seated at one of these tables. I was finishing up my homework with the peaceful ambience of the fountain in the background. There is no place more serene to study because there are usually fewer people on North Campus than on Central Campus.</p>

    <p>Despite the lack of people, the parking lot seemed to have many more cars than people. I wondered where they all could have gone. Many of the students who venture up to North Campus take one of the many Michigan bus routes, minimizing the number of people who would be parked in the parking lot. The buses are usually crowded during the day, but become much emptier at night. The front of the bus has its lights off whereas the back keeps its lights on. An interesting contrast, but one of my favorite things about the buses. When I am hoping to relax and sightsee out the windows, I choose the front of the bus because the darkness allows for a sense of privacy and calmness. When I am accompanied by my friends, I prefer the back. It is easier to see each of their faces in the light and the seating is arranged in a way similar to the shape of a horseshoe, perfect for group conversations.</p>

    <p>To have a group conversation, I would first need a group. Much to my surprise, I found my group on North Campus. If I could go back to the night I found out I would be living in Baits, I would assure myself this was the best thing that could have happened to me. My “bad” luck was actually a blessing in disguise. I would describe how North Campus quickly became an environment that felt like home, one where all my friends were. There is so much negativity surrounding North Campus, but that is simply because people have not taken the time to enjoy it. If people looked past the reputation, they would not fear it so much. It is not the same as Central Campus, but that does not make it a bad place to be. There is so much it has to offer and it is truly such a loss for everyone who has never had the experience to visit. It might have its downsides, but what doesn&apos;t have downsides? Central Campus is the home to both the Modern Language Building and Lorch Hall yet people look past those and focus on the beauty of their neighbors, the Ross School of Business and State Street. Of course North Campus has its downsides, but to only focus on those would be erasing all of the magic hidden away up there. I cannot imagine hammocking in a more peaceful space or finding a larger solvable rubix cube. There are so many ways North Campus is wonderful, I hope each and every Michigan student will someday have the chance to explore and find their own small joys of North Campus.</p>
