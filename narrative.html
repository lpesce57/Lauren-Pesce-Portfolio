    <h1>In Your Eyes</h1>

    <p>Saint Louis is the kind of place where driving twenty minutes takes you to somewhere that looks nothing like where you were twenty minutes ago. So I drove. It was muscle memory. My foot on the gas, pushing my car towards the next scene. I knew how to get there without using a map. It only took twenty minutes to see a shift in terrain but I waited two hours before seeing what my car meant to drive us to. A place I practically grew up in. I used to want to grow up so badly. I wish I would have realized what growing up entailed.</p>

    <p>It was like I never left, the Camp Taum Sauk archway stood tall and firm, as it used to. Kids ran around and the sun glistened. I wondered if, from their point of view, I looked like the tale of “The Old Camper.” A little girl came up to me. She had braces, a permanent smile holding together her face, and a scrape on her chin.</p>

    <p>“Hi, I&apos;m Lauren Pesce,” I surprised myself when I began speaking, “I used to go to camp here. I first came here in middle school and kept coming back until I was a counselor.”</p>

    <p>“Welcome back!” The little girl responded warmly, “Are you visiting anyone?”</p>

    <p>“No, I just wanted to come back and see camp again. I happened to be driving through Lesterville and thought I would stop by and take a look around,” I lied, suddenly hit by the shame around other people&apos;s perception of me.</p>

    <p>“Well, that&apos;s fun! I can give you a tour,” the little girl began walking, without introducing herself.</p>

    <p>“Wow, are those canoes?” I stared in awe, remembering the adventures they used to take me on.</p>

    <p>“Yes! We have a cookout tonight actually. Callum is over there starting to pack the cooler. We are going to Peola. I am so excited Callum came to camp this year, he is from England,” she exclaimed.</p>

    <p>“Oh wow, I haven&apos;t seen Callum in years. My first year, I went on a cookout with him and it was both of our first cookouts,” I sighed. Walking around took me back to the first time I ever stepped onto the grounds of camp. All my memories stored in the trees and dirt. It&apos;s so interesting how people can sell something that belongs to the earth. It&apos;s clear that nature still belongs to the earth at Camp Taum Sauk. Wild animals lurk through the endless forest of trees. The river changes each season. Trash is solely present in bins. The little girl looked into my eyes, seemingly staring into my soul.</p>

    <p>“Did you get Sauk Ton Qua&apos;d?”</p>

    <p>“Yes, I did. My name is Laughing Tigerlily. I may not have been able to speak, but I was nowhere near silent,” I smiled remembering scouring the grounds, giggling, for enough trash to show my sponsor.</p>

    <p>“I can&apos;t wait to be Sauk Ton Qua&apos;d one day. I don&apos;t know much about it though, this is my first year,” the girl admitted.</p>

    <p>“Well, I&apos;m sure you know that it is the initiation into the camp family,” she nodded, “But you spend the entire day learning about the past of the land and camp. You go on a hike up the Taum Sauk mountain and hear a lot of its history. You also pick up trash throughout camp and compete in all the different camp activities. My favorite part was the vow of silence we had to take.”</p>

    <p>“Your favorite part was the silence?” She looked at me perplexed.</p>

    <p>“Yes, that is the way you get most connected with camp and the earth surrounding it. In the absence of human sound, I filled the void with the sounds and sights around me,” I smiled thinking back to our hike. The Taum Sauk Mountain is the tallest point in all of Missouri. I felt like I was on top of the earth, even if only on top of Missouri.”</p>

    <p>“I can&apos;t wait for my turn,” She paused, her eyes emulating the sun shining down on us, “Want to know a secret?”</p>

    <p>Her enthusiasm and excitement for the future embodied the spirit of the camp I remembered. I returned her smile, “I would love to.”</p>

    <p>“My cabin is planning on raiding tonight. We have been collecting cups from dinner over the past few days and finally have enough. We are going to fill them with water and put them in front of Lodge&apos;s door,” she looked around as she spoke, assuring no one overheard her.</p>

    <p>“The term raid seems to imply much more mal intent. Harmless pranks don&apos;t seem like something that would fall under that category. I miss the days of raiding. As I got older, they became more and more strict,” I squinted, looking at the little girl, her LPE monogrammed shirt hitting the sun at just the right angle to hit my eyes, “It&apos;s funny, that was my first raid as well.”</p>
