    <section>
      <p>Throughout <em>Giovanni&apos;s Room</em>, David hesitantly explores his sexuality. His first sexual experience with a man took place a long time ago with his old friend, Joey. David admits, “A lifetime would not be long enough for me to act with Joey the act of love” (8). Instead of allowing himself a lifetime with Joey, David leaves the next morning, terminating their friendship and any potential romantic or sexual involvement. Not only does he cut off connections, David also begins acting with cruelty towards Joey. Hoping to escape his life in America and in the army, David moves to Paris and meets Giovanni. David repeatedly tries to repress his feelings for Giovanni but is unsuccessful. He seems to have a distaste for everyone but himself, frequently making homophobic, misogynistic and many other overall hateful remarks. It is not until Giovanni&apos;s execution that David is able to wholeheartedly admit to both himself and others his love for Giovanni. Throughout David&apos;s struggle to come to terms with his sexuality he often deflects his inner turmoil onto others, resulting in trouble for both himself and those around him.</p>

      <p>David does not try to hide his disapproval of the lifestyle of homosexual men. He frequently mocks their every move, referring to them as “les folles” (26). Each time David was bothered by these men it was usually over something mundane, such as “their love affairs always seemed hilarious” (26). He never expressed his irritation with anyone else&apos;s laughter and was only annoyed when it was about a subject he deemed taboo. David saw homosexual men as weak and did not believe they were real men, stating “I always found it difficult to believe that they ever went to bed with anybody, for a man who wanted a woman would certainly have rather had a real one” (27). His irritation was irrational, as he was not the one having sexual relations with any of these men. However, his anger likely comes from jealousy and seems to be used as a defense against his true desires. Later that same night, one of the men comes up to David and implies he and Giovanni are romantically involved. David instantly snaps at him to “go to Hell” (40). His sudden shift in mood implies a strong aversion to the thought of others perceiving him as a homosexual. Previous to this conversation, he had been smiling and enjoying his conversation with Giovanni. It was not until someone else believed they were involved romantically or sexually that David felt animosity. His anger is likely due to his repression of his feelings about Giovanni and desire for secrecy about his sexuality. When someone else is able to notice the thoughts he desperately tries to repress, he becomes defensive. In order to keep his homosexual thoughts hidden from both himself and others, David feels the need to show aggression and opposition. He sees aggression as a manly characteristic, something he feels homosexual men lack. Therefore, when he is exerting aggression towards the homosexual man, it is as if David is affirming his dominance and superiority. If he is superior to the man, David feels more manly and sees this as proof he is not a homosexual.</p>

      <p>David&apos;s battle with manliness continues throughout as he combats each person, thought or circumstance that makes him feel weak. The biggest obstacle in his relationship with Giovanni was often thought of as Hella, however it was in fact David&apos;s shame and stubbornness. David and Giovanni got into a routine when they first began living together, something David originally enjoyed. He chose to clean Giovanni&apos;s room while he was gone and loved knowing he was able to make Giovanni happy. However, as soon as he had the thought, “I am not a housewife—men can never be housewives,” (88) he no longer enjoyed cleaning for Giovanni. David saw no previous issue to cleaning each day and even enjoyed the smile and gratitude Giovanni would express each day when he returned. It was simply the act of doing a task he felt belonged to a woman. This made David feel like the woman of the relationship, making it more apparent they had a romantic connection, something David often tries to stifle. Additionally, if he was perceived as doing womanly tasks, he felt more connected to “les folles,” something he tried desperately to avoid.</p>

      <p>Despite David&apos;s feelings for Giovanni, he often purposefully hurt him. Not only did David disappear with no warning, when they did see each other again and Giovanni expressed his anguish in David&apos;s absence. Instead of responding with remorse, David retorted, “I don&apos;t see what you&apos;ve got to complain about, you sure knew where to go” (129). It is evident he is jealous of Jacques&apos; sudden closeness with Giovanni while he has been stuck with Hella, someone he only pretends to love. Instead of expressing his sadness and longing for Giovanni, he chooses to take out his frustrations on him. David wants to love Hella and forget about Giovanni hence why he lashes out, to make Giovanni into someone he is disgusted by. He chooses to transform his jealousy into anger in hopes of not only asserting his masculinity but also to force himself to think about Giovanni in a negative light. Additionally, he hopes to maintain the secrecy of his relationship with Giovanni to Hella so his aggression is his attempt in expressing an unfavorable opinion of Giovanni and homosexuals. He does so by trying to appear superior to any man who relies on another man.</p>

      <p>Another way David attempts to express his manliness is through his negative demeanor towards women. He constantly makes derogatory comments about women and even admits “I don&apos;t see what&apos;s so hard about being a woman. At least, not as long as she&apos;s got a man” (124). He sees them as nothing more than an accessory to men, making his lack of respect apparent. David chose to go home with a woman named Sue, despite describing her as “not pretty” and “[trying] to indicate to the world how little she cared for appearance or sensuality” (95). Therefore, him going home with her proves he only sees her as an object for his own personal gain as opposed to a person with feelings. David has described previous sexual acts in poetic ways, as an act of making love. However, he described his night with Sue as more of an obligation and a conquest to prove his interest in women to himself, despite the night having the opposite effect. David is only focused on his own personal gain and is not bothered by the thoughts of having sexual intercourse with someone he knows he is uninterested in, despite the pain it could cause the woman.</p>

      <p>If David had more respect for women, he would have felt more compassion for the many women he hurt in his process of self discovery. More importantly, how his actions impacted Hella. The majority of the novel, she was led astray by false promises of love from David. He formed a relationship with a man knowing she was returning and expecting their engagement. However, David was so absorbed in the shame from his love for Giovanni, he continued to lead her to believe his promise of their future together. To David, she is the best defense he has against his homosexuality. No homosexual man is engaged to a woman, therefore he cannot be a homosexual.</p>

      <p>David was evidently somewhat aware of his feelings for Giovanni. They lived together, had sexual intercourse and shared many other intimate moments together. Regardless of if David was able to process his feelings for Giovanni, if he had any respect for Hella, he wouldn&apos;t have tried to do so while still in a relationship with her. It is still cheating if it is with a man. Nonetheless, David sees his desires and needs as more important than Hella&apos;s feelings because he is the man of the relationship and does not truly respect her or any other woman. Because David does not like women, they do not have any value to him. Therefore their feelings are irrelevant to him because he sees himself as superior, as more masculine.</p>

      <p>In the end of the novel, Hella catches David with another man and confronts him about his relationship with both the man and Giovanni. It is evident that David is self aware enough in his homosexuality enough to recognize he is not interested in Hella romantically but refuses to end their relationship because once their relationship ends, David has no way left to prove he is not homosexual. However, David does not care about the impact this has on Hella. She was led to believe he was in love with her and he knew that but did not care. While he may not have been willing to admit that to himself or Hella, he had enough of a perception of his sexuality to understand he did not love Hella and should not have continued their relationship. He has had sexual experiences with multiple men, some during their relationship as well as his relationship with Giovanni being romantic too. Whether he was ready to admit to himself and others he is attracted to men romantically and sexually, he knew way before Hella found out. After having multiple sexual relationships with men, it no longer becomes an accident or a random coincidence he can justify keeping a secret from Hella. Whether or not he understood or admitted the full extent of his interest in men to Hella, he should have at minimum broken up with her while he took the time to figure it out. Instead, he held her back from others she may have been interested in because he wasn&apos;t able to be at least partially honest with her. David hoped that by attempting to ignore his attraction towards men and proposing to Hella, he would be able to permanently suppress his desires. However, because he was not truly interested in her, he was never able to do so and ended up unnecessarily hurting her.</p>

      <p>David finally comes to terms with his sexuality and the damages he caused while trying to repress it and deflect his insecurities onto others. After Hella departs, David looks into his mirror, claiming “I am terribly aware of the mirror” (167). The mirror represents him looking at his authentic self, someone whose eyes he had been desperately avoiding. He has tried to hide from himself for so long that the mirror feels like an inevitable trap. David watched Hella depart, meaning the end of their relationship and his relationship with women. Additionally, Giovanni is likely being executed any minute, the end of a romance David never let happen. Both these events combined force him to reflect on his choices and what he needs to improve for the future. David “long[s] to crack that mirror and be free” (168). It took such tragic and impactful losses in his life for him to realize how much his denial is hurting not only himself but those he loves. Throughout the novel he repeatedly hurt those around him because he was unable to be authentic. It took losing the one he loved so passionately to realize how much he was hurting himself by trying to convince the world he was someone he was not. Because he was too afraid to love Giovanni, he permanently lost the chance. It took him until it was too late to realize the repercussions of living a lie were greater than any consequences he could have faced for being authentically himself.</p>
